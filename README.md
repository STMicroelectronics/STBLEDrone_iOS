# ST BLE Drone

This repository contains the ST BLE Drone app source code.

The ST Drone is an STEVAL-FCU001V1 board, based on STM32 processor and ST sensors such as the 9-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, pressure, temperature and BLE.
The GUI allows to pilot the ST Drone after the BLE connection has been established, then the drone is driven by touchable analog cursors.
